Was coded in IntelliJ, but exportet for Eclipse(works in Eclipse), war file is included for deploy

Screenshots included if you cant get it to run, hit counter already used bc of debug (was testing bought site)

Everything works!
Intruder is in servlet and jsp detected (if he manages to single call either), Session Hijacking is denied too ! (sessionId test)

For further questions pls ask
